### It’s BS that a ⭐️ 5-day ⭐️ Design Sprint will transform your business. 🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️

_Hint: You’re going to need a few more than one!_

**Here’s what you’ll get at the end of a week of design sprinting:**
- assumptions that need a bunch more design thinking work before you can call them robust assumptions
- an indication of appetite
- a better understanding of the problem you’re trying to solve
- a more focussed understanding of the direction of travel
- a more connected and inspired team
